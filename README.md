## What is Attestation Station

The AttestationStation is an attestation smart contract deployed on Optimism
which enables anyone to make attestations or claims about any Ethereum address on the blockchain. By leveraging the power of decentralized technology, AttestationStation provides a secure and transparent way for parties to attest to the validity of certain information without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries.
 </br>
The goal of the AttestationStation is to provide a permissionless and accessible data source for builders creating reputation-based applications. By enabling anyone to make arbitrary attestations about other addresses, we can create a rich library of qualitative and quantitative data that can be used across the ecosystem.
</br>
In laymen terms, it allows an authority to make "attestations" about a particular address.
Scope of the "attestation" is made

## What are Attestations?
The AttestationStation smart contract contains a public attestations mapping that anyone can write to and read from.
